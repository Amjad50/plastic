NAME

    plastic - NES emulator with both graphical (GUI) and terminal (TUI) interfaces.

SYNOPSIS

    plastic 
    plastic_tui [rom-file] [-a]

DESCRIPTION

    plastic is a NES emulator written in Rust, designed to run NES games through two different interfaces: a graphical (GUI) interface and a terminal-based (TUI) interface.

    The graphical interface (plastic) does not require any arguments and launches the emulator with a simple, user-friendly graphical interface.

    The terminal-based interface (plastic_tui) allows users to run the emulator in the terminal with optional flags.

OPTIONS

    plastic
        Launches the graphical interface of the emulator. This mode does not take any arguments.

    plastic_tui [rom-file] [-a]
        Launches the terminal-based interface. The following options are supported:
        - rom-file: Specifies the NES ROM file to load.
        - -a: Disables audio output while running the emulator in TUI mode.

INSTALLATION

    The latest version of plastic and plastic_tui can be installed using Cargo:
